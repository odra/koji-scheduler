# Koji Builder Kube

This is an attempt to re-create a koji-builder to be used as a scheduler for running tasks.

Extremely early stage.

## Development

This is a poetry based project but there is a `Makefile` file to make it easier.

A  `setup.py` file is required to build the container image which can be generated by running `hack/poetrytosetuoppy` (`dephell` CLI required) from the root folder.

The project also uses typing annotations and mypy.

A sample configuration file can be found in `tests/fixtures`.
